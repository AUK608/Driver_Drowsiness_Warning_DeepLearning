# Driver_Drowsiness_Warning_DeepLearning
This repository is for DDW(Driver Drowsiness Warning Deep Learning Project) using FRCNN with Resnet50 and Custom Backbone in Pytorch=1.10

This repository contains implementation in the form of jupyter notebook(.ipynb). Every cell in the notebook has information comments which can help the user to understand the code better.

The Inputs and Outputs are zipped and kept separately.

The References to Inputs, Codes, Issues, Solutions, etc., are kept in text files. The Libraries installed with the version is also kept in text files.

The Model has been trained on NVIDIA RTX 3080 10GB variant.
